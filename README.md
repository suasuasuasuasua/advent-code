To be honest, I'm still not that great at programming. I've seen other's solutions for these challenges, and mine are nowhere near as short or elegant.

Moreover, I'm still very far behind. I'm not going to finish 2021, most likely.

Though I could write in something like `Python` or `JavaScript`, I think that there is too much coding *magic* going on, so I decided to write in `C++`. This way, I can figure things out more algorithmically; though this is definitely challenging, I feel this may be most beneficial for growth.
