## Unit 3

### Heat of Reaction

**The heat of reaction describes the net energy flow in a system.**

If the $\Delta H_{rxn}$ is positive, then then energy must have been added; else, removed.

Though $\Delta H_{rxn}$ is a $\text{J}$ quantity, when it is divided by a molar amount according to a chemical formula, it becomes a $\dfrac{\text{J}}{\text{mol}}$ quantity. 

- This means that you can multiply it some amount of molar substance to find the energy associated with it.

### Heat of Formation

**Heat of formation questions ask you to calculate $\Delta H_{rxn}$ using the standard enthalpies of formation.**

Refer to the equation sheet.

Take sum of the standard enthalpies of formation on the product side, then subtract from the product side.

Remember to multiply by the coefficients.

$$
\Delta H_{rxn} = \sum n\Delta H_{f}(\text{products}) - \sum n\Delta H_{f}(\text{reactants})
$$

### Heat

$q = mC_{sp}\Delta T$ describes the heat associated with a substance, as it undergoes a change in temperature.

When two substance with differing specific heats interact with different initial temperatures, the final temperature will come closer to the substance with the higher specific heat.

## Polarity

To see if a molecules is polar, we can run through a couple of steps.

- If the $\Delta \text{EN}$ of two elements is greater than 0.5, then a diatomic bond is said to be polar. Else, the bond is nonpolar. Note that a molecule with polar bonds can still be overall nonpolar if the geometry is even.

- We have to consider the geometric shape of the molecule by drawing the Lewis Structure. Generally, if there are lone pairs, then the molecule is going to polar; though, if the resulting shape is symmetric, such as linear, then the molecule will be nonpolar.

Polarity is important because polar molecules interact strongly with with other polar molecules, but do not interact with nonpolar molecules, and vice versa.

The attractions that covalent molecules can feel are the following:

- LD: all molecules and atoms experience London Dispersion Forces
- DD: polar molecules experience dipole-dipole forces
- HB: bonds of H to O, N, F experience hydrogen bonding

### Intensive Properties

Polar and nonpolar molecules are not soluble in each other; moreover, they do not interact strongly.

- Note that polar and ioic substances interact.

The higher the IMF strength, the higher the boiling point of a substance (think about how strong bonds will keep a substance from escaping into the gaseous space).

- Note that the boiling point also depends on molar mass of a substance, if the observed attractions are all the same (think about how it is harder to move substances with higher mass).

The higher the IMF strength, the higher the viscosity of a substance; moreover, the higher the surface area and length, the greater the viscosity because there is more potential for interaction between molecules (think internal friction).

The higher the temperature, the higher the vapor pressure of a substance (think about how higher temperatures may energize the substance to exit liquid to gaseous state).

The higher the surface area of the substance, the greater the **rate of vaporiztaion AND rate of condensation** (think about how there is more room for the substance to escape into the gaseous state & return to liquid state).

- Substances that are likely to evaporate are said to be **volatile**.

The higher the IMF strength, the more likely a substance is going to be a solid or liquid at room temperature (think about how the IMFs will keep the substance bound together).

The higher the IMF strength, the higher the surface tension of the substance (think about how the IMFs are pulling and holding the substance together; the substance will want to resist external change).
